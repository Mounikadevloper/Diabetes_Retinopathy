This project is a deep learning-based application designed to detect and classify the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal fundus images. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and helps in early diagnosis, enabling timely medical intervention and treatment planning.

ðŸš€ Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a CNN-based architecture for accurate image classification.

Automated Diagnosis: Classifies retinal images into different severity levels of Diabetic Retinopathy.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access.

Real-Time Analysis: Upload an image or capture using your camera to get instant predictions.

Camera Integration: Supports real-time image capture via HTML5/WebRTC.

->Tech Stack
Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Frontend: Gradio (for user interface)

Dataset: Kaggleâ€™s Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset

Deployment: Hugging Face Spaces

Camera Integration: HTML5 / WebRTC

ðŸ“Œ Usage
Upload a retinal (fundus) image or capture one using your device's camera.

The model will analyze the image and classify the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Results are displayed instantly with confidence scores.
